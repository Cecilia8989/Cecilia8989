## 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and software development:

### 🟣 PfDA Project 1: Violence Against Women – A Data Analysis  
This project explores the prevalence of physical and/or sexual violence against women in a sample of 500 individuals over a 5-year period.  
Using statistical techniques and visualizations, it analyzes how key variables—such as **education level**, **region**, **occupation**, and **marital status**—correlate with the likelihood of experiencing violence.  
The project highlights the use of **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly)** and **Jupyter Notebooks** to investigate complex social issues with empathy and data rigor.

### 🔵 WSSA Project 2024: RESTful API for Employee Management  
This project implements a RESTful web application that allows users to register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on an employee database.  
It features secure user authentication and role-based access to data management, all built with a lightweight tech stack for flexibility and performance.  
The project highlights the use of **Python (Flask, Flask-Login, MySQL)** and **JavaScript (jQuery)** to build dynamic, full-stack applications.  

### 🌍 PfDA Project 2
A comprehensive exploration of historical and current climate data, focusing on CO₂ trends, polar ice coverage, and regional impacts in Ireland. Includes predictive modeling of future climate scenarios. A data storytelling project with a strong environmental perspective.

### 🐧 Data Analysis: Palmer Penguins & Iris Dataset
Exploratory data analysis and classification tasks using statistical techniques and machine learning. These projects highlight my understanding of feature engineering, data visualization, and model evaluation.

### 🧮 Python Programming Projects
From beginner to intermediate scripts, this repository includes:
- `HelloWorld.py`: Classic hello world script.
- `Accounts.py`: Account masking tool.
- `Collatz.py`: Collatz sequence explorer.
- `Plot.py`: Normal distribution visualizer.
These scripts reflect my journey through core programming fundamentals.
