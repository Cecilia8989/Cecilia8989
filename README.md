## üåü Featured Projects

Here are a few projects that showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and software development:

### üîµ [Violence Against Women in italy ‚Äì A Data Analysis](https://github.com/Cecilia8989/PfDA_Assignement)

This project investigates the prevalence of **physical and/or sexual violence** against women in Italy, focusing on incidents occurring over a **5-year period**, committed by either a current or former partner.
üîé The analysis aims to uncover how **education level**, **region of residence**, **occupation**, and **marital status** correlate with the likelihood of experiencing violence. These variables are explored to understand patterns and potential risk factors through a data-driven lens.

> 1 in 3 women globally experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime ‚Äî data analysis can help bring visibility to this silent crisis.

### üîµ [WSSA Project 2024: RESTful API for Employee Management](https://github.com/Cecilia8989/WSAA-Project)
This project implements a RESTful web application that allows users to register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on an employee database.  
It features secure user authentication and role-based access to data management, all built with a lightweight tech stack for flexibility and performance.  
The project highlights the use of **Python (Flask, Flask-Login, MySQL)** and **JavaScript (jQuery)** to build dynamic, full-stack applications.  

### üîµ [PfDA Project 2 ‚Äì Climate Data Analysis](https://github.com/Cecilia8989/PfDA_Project2)

This repository contains Project 2 for the module *Programming for Data Analysis*, part of the Higher Diploma in Computer Science with Data Analytics at Atlantic Technological University.The project presents an analysis of climate data, focusing on the relationship between atmospheric CO‚ÇÇ levels and temperature anomalies over the last 800,000 years. It also examines additional climate indicators such as methane concentrations and polar ice coverage, along with a regional study of climate change signals in Ireland.

The dataset is created by merging data from multiple sources into a unified pandas DataFrame, exported in both CSV and JSON formats. The analysis investigates temporal trends, frequency patterns, and lead-lag relationships. It includes a predictive model of future temperature anomalies and a comparison with established climate projections.

### üîµ [Applied Statistics Assessment 2024 - Statistical Analysis of the PlantGrowth Dataset](https://github.com/Cecilia8989/applied_statistics_assessment)  
This project applies core statistical techniques to explore and compare plant growth across different treatment groups using the classic **PlantGrowth** dataset.  
It includes both **t-tests** (for pairwise group comparisons) and **one-way ANOVA** (to assess differences among all groups), with attention to the assumptions behind each test and the interpretation of results.  
The analysis provides insight into how controlled experiments can be evaluated using inferential statistics and how statistical rigor supports reproducible conclusions in data science.

### üîµ [Fundamentals for Data Analysis: Iris Dataset Exploration & Python Tasks](https://github.com/Cecilia8989/fund_data_analysis)
This project combines a series of Python-based exercises and a final exploratory analysis of the famous **Iris dataset** to demonstrate foundational concepts in data analysis and statistical thinking.

The final notebook focuses on understanding the structure and behavior of the dataset through the lens of **variable classification, summary statistics, and data visualization**. Each variable is described and analyzed using appropriate descriptive measures and plotted with clear, purposeful visuals. The notebook emphasizes the use of Python‚Äôs data analysis stack in telling a cohesive story around one of the most iconic datasets in machine learning history.

## ü§ù Let‚Äôs Connect!
I'm always excited to meet fellow data enthusiasts and collaborate on meaningful projects.
